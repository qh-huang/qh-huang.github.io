I’m a software engineer who loves shooting and solving challenging problems in real world. With experience in both large-scale companies and start-up, I’m able to work independently but also a great team player.  

I've participated different kinds of projects including mature industrial product (i.e. Android mobile device) and innovative prototyping from scratch (i.e. robot product). I’m currently working on robot product Zenbo in AsusTek.
