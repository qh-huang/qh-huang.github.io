In the robot project of ASUS, I was responsible for the localization function of our robot. My work includes:
## 1. Provide APIs for other software engineers to use.  
Since the OS was Android, I implemented the localization system as an Android Service. The system was divided to Java layer and native (C++) layer; the Java layer provides the APIs for other Android Applications to call, and the algorithm was implemented in the native layer.
## 2. Design tools for algorithms verification, data collection and analyzation
I developed various tools on top of ROS, OpenCV, PCL to collect and analyze data for verifying algorithms. With my tools, I can easily tune the parameters of our model or add new features to our system.
